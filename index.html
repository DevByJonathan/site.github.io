      In 2023, the group reported approximately 8.6 million members involved in
      evangelism, with around 20.5 million attending the annual Memorial of
      Christ's death.[6][en 1] Jehovah's Witnesses believe that the destruction
      of the present world system at Armageddon is imminent, and the
      establishment of God's kingdom over earth is the only solution to all of
      humanity's problems.
